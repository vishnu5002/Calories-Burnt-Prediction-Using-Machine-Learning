# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Objective: The primary goal is to estimate the calories burnt based on various personal and activity-related features. These features include user-specific information (such as gender, age, height, weight) and activity-related data (duration, heart rate, body temperature).
Datasets: The project uses two datasets:
Exercise Dataset: Contains information related to physical activities, including features like duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
Calories Dataset: Includes data on the number of calories burned during specific activities.
Model Development: The project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. By training on the provided datasets, the model learns patterns and relationships between features and calorie burn.
User Input: When a user provides input data (e.g., gender, age, height, weight, duration, heart rate, body temperature), the model predicts the corresponding calories burnt.
Application: This prediction can be valuable for individuals seeking to optimize their workout routines, monitor fitness goals, or manage weight loss.
